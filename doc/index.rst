Welcome to Beam Interactive
===========================

Beam Interactive is a new way to let viewers directly control the environment around streamers using a visual interface. It works with any game and is built into the Beam platform. Interactive games can be played with streamers or fully autonomously.

Developers can create integrations with as few as 25 lines of code and receive input from viewers to influence a live stream directly. To better facilitate real time interactions, we've developed an entirely new streaming architecture to enable real-time visual feedback at less than 1 second of latency.
